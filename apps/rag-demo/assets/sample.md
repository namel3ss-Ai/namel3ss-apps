# Namel3ss RAG Demo

This demo shows deterministic ingestion, hybrid retrieval, and grounded answers.

- The runtime enforces citations for answer claims.
- Retrieval remains stable across replays.
- Explain views show why each chunk was selected.
- The strongest evidence is the explain bundle: it shows ranked candidates, selection order, and citation checks.
