# Roadmap (Post Phase 5)

This roadmap is intentionally conservative: reliability first.

## Near-term

1. Tighten golden eval coverage for edge-case no-support questions.
2. Add screenshot automation for README placeholders.
3. Add optional accessibility pass for keyboard-heavy demo navigation.

## Mid-term

1. Add corpus-scale performance profile docs (latency + memory bands).
2. Add a deterministic migration guide for schema/record changes.
3. Add hosted deployment recipes beyond Render (Cloud Run / Fly.io).

## Long-term

1. Publish a versioned "reference implementation" branch strategy.
2. Expand learning assets with side-by-side trace walkthroughs.
3. Add contributor certification checklist for deterministic changes.

## Non-goals

- Opaque agent loops that hide control flow.
- Features that reduce citation quality or replayability.
- Prompt-only behavior changes without corresponding program changes.
